# Project State

## Client

**Angie's Custom Cleaning** — Cleaning business in Lancaster, PA
- Phone: 717-615-0968
- Address: 340 Abbeyville Road, Lancaster, PA 17603
- Hours: Monday-Friday 9am-4pm
- Two divisions: commercial and residential cleaning

## Sales Context

- Cold outreach via email — no reply yet
- Mutual friend confirmed she needs a web developer
- Previous developer took $5K and stopped responding
- **Strategy:** Build two polished demo sites, deploy to live URLs, send as follow-up proof
- No pitch needed — the work speaks for itself

## Current Phase

**Project setup complete.** Ready to begin demo builds.

## Build Approach

Static sites (HTML/CSS/JS) deployed to Vercel or Netlify for shareable demo URLs. The current WordPress sites are the reference — we recreate and improve them.

## Current Site Analysis

### Commercial Site (angiescommercialcleaning.com)
- **Platform:** WordPress + WPBakery Page Builder
- **Content:** Weekly office cleaning, carpet steam cleaning, floor services
- **Trust signals:** Angie's List awards, Readers' Choice badges
- **Contact:** Form (Contact Form 7) + phone + address
- **Design:** Dated, uses RevSlider carousel, heavy page builder markup

### Residential Site (angiescustomcleaning.com)
- **Platform:** WordPress + WPBakery + WooCommerce
- **Content:** Residential and commercial cleaning services
- **E-commerce:** Gift card sales via WooCommerce
- **Trust signals:** Reader's Choice, Super Service Award, Angie's List
- **Design:** Similar dated style, RevSlider, heavy markup
- **Note:** Gift card functionality won't be in demo (would need Stripe/Square integration for production)

## Demo Scope

Each demo site needs:
- [ ] Hero section with clear value proposition
- [ ] Services overview (what they clean, service areas)
- [ ] Trust signals (awards, years in business, background-checked staff)
- [ ] About section (Angie's story / personal touch)
- [ ] Contact section (phone, address, hours, contact form placeholder)
- [ ] Responsive design (mobile-first)
- [ ] Fast loading (no WordPress bloat)
- [ ] Clean, modern aesthetic

## Completed
