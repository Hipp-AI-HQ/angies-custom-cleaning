# Angie's Custom Cleaning — Demo Sites

## What This Is

Two polished demo websites (commercial and residential) for Angie's Custom Cleaning, a cleaning business in Lancaster, PA. These are sales tools — deployed to live Vercel URLs and sent via email to win the client. Angie's previous developer took $5K and disappeared, so the work needs to speak for itself with no pitch meeting.

## Core Value

The demos must immediately look better than Angie's current WordPress sites — faster, cleaner, mobile-friendly, and visually trustworthy — so she reaches out to move forward.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Commercial site with hero, services, trust signals, about, and contact sections
- [ ] Residential site with hero, services, trust signals, about, and contact sections
- [ ] Shared blue brand identity across both sites (matching her logo, not the purple she dislikes)
- [ ] Warm, trustworthy design aesthetic — friendly, community feel
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design
- [ ] Fast loading — static HTML/CSS/JS, no framework bloat
- [ ] Real content from her current sites (no fabricated information)
- [ ] Award badges and credentials prominently displayed (Angie's List, Readers' Choice, Super Service Award)
- [ ] Contact information visible (phone, address, hours)
- [ ] Service descriptions for each division (commercial: office, carpet, floor; residential: home cleaning)
- [ ] Angie's personal story / founder bio
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel with shareable URLs

### Out of Scope

- Working e-commerce / gift card purchasing — demo only, would need Stripe/Square for production
- Blog — not needed for demo or client pitch
- Working contact form submission — placeholder form is sufficient for demo
- WordPress admin or CMS — static sites only
- Custom domain setup — Vercel preview URLs for demo, real domains if she signs on

## Context

- **Sales situation:** Cold outreach via email, no reply yet. Mutual friend confirmed she needs a developer. Previous dev took $5K and stopped responding.
- **Strategy:** Build two polished demos, deploy to live URLs, send as follow-up proof. No pitch needed — the work speaks for itself.
- **Brand pain point:** Angie doesn't like the purple on her residential site (angiescustomcleaning.com). Her actual brand is blue, matching the commercial site (angiescommercialcleaning.com).
- **Current sites:** Both run WordPress + WPBakery Page Builder with RevSlider carousels. Heavy, dated, slow.
- **Two divisions:** Commercial cleaning (offices, carpets, floors) and residential cleaning (home cleaning, gift cards).
- **Service area:** Lancaster County and York, PA.
- **Business info:** 717-615-0968, 340 Abbeyville Road, Lancaster PA 17603, Mon-Fri 9am-4pm.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Static HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, no build tools, deployed via GitHub → Vercel
- **Content**: Must use real information from existing sites — nothing fabricated
- **Design**: Blue brand palette (from commercial site logo), warm & trustworthy aesthetic
- **Scope**: Demo quality — impressive but not production-complete (no working forms, no e-commerce)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Static HTML/CSS/JS over framework | Demo sites don't need React/Vue complexity; faster to build, faster to load | — Pending |
| Blue brand palette, drop purple | Angie actively dislikes the purple; blue matches her actual brand/logo | — Pending |
| Shared brand family across both sites | Same business, should feel cohesive even with different service focus | — Pending |
| Vercel for hosting | Simple GitHub integration, free tier, instant deploy, shareable URLs | — Pending |
