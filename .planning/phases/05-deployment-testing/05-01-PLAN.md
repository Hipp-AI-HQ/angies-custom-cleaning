       - Residential URL
       - Deployment timestamp
       - Vercel project IDs
       - Any deployment notes

    If any errors: Check Vercel deployment logs via `vercel inspect [URL]`

Run these checks to confirm deployment success:

1. **URL accessibility:**
   - curl -I https://angies-commercial-cleaning.vercel.app returns 200
   - curl -I https://angies-residential-cleaning.vercel.app returns 200

2. **Visual completeness:**
   - Open each URL in browser
   - All sections visible (hero, services, testimonials, footer)
   - No broken images (check browser console)
   - Fonts load correctly (Nunito headings, Open Sans body)

3. **Static resources:**
   - CSS files load (no flash of unstyled content)
   - JavaScript files load (AOS animations work)
   - Images load (WebP with fallbacks)

4. **No errors:**
   - Browser console shows no 404 errors
   - Browser console shows no JavaScript errors
