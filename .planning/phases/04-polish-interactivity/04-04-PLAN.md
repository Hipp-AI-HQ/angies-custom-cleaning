<objective>
Human verification checkpoint to confirm all Phase 4 polish and interactivity features work correctly across both sites and all viewports.

Purpose: Ensure scroll animations, mobile CTA, hover effects, and hamburger menu are polished and bug-free before moving to Phase 5 deployment. This is the quality gate before showing demos to the client.

Output: User-verified confirmation that both sites feel premium and modern, or identification of any issues needing fixes before deployment.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete polish and interactivity for both commercial and residential sites:

**From Plan 04-01 (AOS & Smooth Scroll):**
- AOS library integrated via CDN (v2.3.4)
- Scroll animations (fade-up) on all major sections and cards
- Staggered delays on cards (0ms, 100ms, 200ms)
- Smooth scroll behavior on anchor link clicks
- Accessibility support (prefers-reduced-motion)

**From Plan 04-02 (Mobile CTA & Hover Effects):**
- Fixed mobile CTA bar at bottom on mobile (<= 768px)
- Desktop hover effects on buttons (lift 4px + shadow)
- Desktop hover effects on service cards (lift 8px + shadow)
- Z-index scale for stacking contexts
- Body padding to prevent CTA overlap

**From Plan 04-03 (Hamburger Menu):**
- Hamburger button with three-line icon
- Slide-in navigation from right on mobile
- Overlay backdrop with semi-transparent black
- Full accessibility (ARIA, focus management, Escape key)
- Menu closes on nav link click
  </what-built>

  <how-to-verify>
Open both sites locally and test comprehensively across viewports:

## 1. Commercial Site - Desktop (1024px+)

**Scroll Animations:**
1. Open commercial/index.html in browser (full desktop width)
2. Scroll down slowly from hero section
3. Verify services section fades up when ~50px from viewport bottom
4. Verify service cards stagger (first → second → third with 100ms delays)
5. Continue scrolling: verify each section fades up (why-us, process, stats, testimonials, about, contact)
6. Scroll back up and down again → animations should NOT re-trigger (once: true working)

**Hover Effects:**
7. Hover over any CTA button (hero CTA, contact button)
8. Verify button lifts up ~4px with shadow transition (smooth, not instant)
9. Move mouse away → button returns to normal
10. Hover over service cards → verify 8px lift with shadow
11. Verify all hover transitions are smooth (60fps, no jank)

**Smooth Scroll:**
12. Click any navigation link (e.g., "Services" in header)
13. Verify page scrolls smoothly to target section (not instant jump)
14. URL should update with anchor hash (#services)

**Hamburger Menu:**
15. Resize to desktop (> 768px) → verify hamburger is NOT visible
16. Navigation links should be visible in header as normal

## 2. Commercial Site - Mobile (375px)

**Mobile CTA:**
1. DevTools Responsive mode → 375px width
2. Verify orange "Call Now: 717-615-0968" button fixed at bottom
3. Scroll down and up → button stays at bottom (doesn't scroll away)
4. Scroll to footer → verify footer content is NOT covered by button
5. Click/tap button → should show phone dialer (or alert if desktop browser)

**Scroll Animations:**
6. Scroll down slowly from top
7. Verify sections and cards fade up as before (mobile animations enabled)
8. Performance should feel smooth (no stuttering)

**Hamburger Menu:**
9. Verify three-line hamburger icon visible in header (top right area)
10. Tap hamburger → navigation menu slides in from right
11. Verify menu covers ~80% of viewport width
12. Verify semi-transparent black overlay appears behind menu
13. Verify hamburger animates to X shape
14. Page content should NOT scroll behind open menu

**Menu Close Methods:**
15. Tap hamburger (X) → menu slides out, overlay fades
16. Open menu again, tap overlay backdrop → menu closes
17. Open menu again, tap any nav link → menu closes AND scrolls to section
18. (If possible) Open menu, press Escape key → menu closes

**Hover Effects:**
19. Tap button or service card → should NOT have hover effect
20. No sticky hover state after tap (touch devices have hover disabled)

## 3. Residential Site - Desktop (1024px+)

**Repeat all desktop tests from Commercial site:**
- Scroll animations on all sections (services, why-us, process, stats, gift-cards, testimonials, about, contact)
- Gift cards section should also fade up
- Gift card pricing cards should stagger
- Hover effects on buttons and cards
- Smooth scroll on nav links
- No hamburger visible

## 4. Residential Site - Mobile (375px)

**Repeat all mobile tests from Commercial site:**
- Mobile CTA at bottom
- Scroll animations work
- Hamburger menu functions correctly
- Menu has "Gift Cards" link (additional to commercial)
- All close methods work
- No sticky hover on touch

## 5. Cross-Browser Testing (if possible)

**Test in at least 2 browsers:**
- Chrome/Edge (primary)
- Safari (iOS behavior)
- Firefox (validation)

**Check for:**
- AOS animations work in all browsers
- Mobile CTA appears correctly
- Hamburger menu functions
- No console errors

## 6. Accessibility Testing

**Reduced Motion:**
1. DevTools → Cmd+Shift+P → "Emulate CSS prefers-reduced-motion"
2. Refresh page and scroll
3. Verify NO animations occur (instant appearance, not fade-up)
4. Verify smooth scroll is disabled (instant jump to sections)

**Keyboard Navigation:**
1. Desktop viewport
2. Tab through page → focus indicators should be visible
3. Tab to hamburger (mobile) → press Enter → menu opens
4. First nav link should be focused
5. Press Escape → menu closes, focus returns to hamburger

**Screen Reader (optional but recommended):**
1. Turn on screen reader (VoiceOver on Mac: Cmd+F5)
2. Navigate to hamburger button → should announce "Menu button"
3. Navigate to nav → should announce "Primary navigation"

## 7. Performance Check

**Desktop:**
1. Open DevTools → Performance tab
2. Record while scrolling down page
3. Stop recording and check FPS → should maintain 60fps
4. Check for excessive repaints or layout thrashing

**Mobile:**
1. DevTools → Responsive mode → 375px + throttle to "Mid-tier mobile"
2. Record performance while scrolling
3. Verify smooth scrolling (no frame drops below 30fps)

## 8. Final Polish Check

**Overall feel:**
- Does the site feel premium and modern?
- Are animations subtle and professional (not jarring)?
- Do interactions feel smooth and responsive?
- Is there any jank, lag, or bugginess?

**Visual consistency:**
- Do both sites feel like the same brand?
- Are animation timings consistent?
- Does mobile CTA match brand colors?
- Do hover effects feel natural?

## Issues to Watch For

Common problems from research (04-RESEARCH.md):
- AOS animations don't trigger on mobile (should be enabled)
- Sticky hover on mobile touch (should be disabled)
- Mobile CTA covers footer content (body padding should prevent)
- Menu doesn't close after nav link tap (should close)
- Body scrolls behind open menu (should be prevented)
- Hamburger doesn't return focus after Escape (should return to button)

**Report any bugs, jank, or issues encountered during testing.**
