<objective>
Verify that the complete commercial cleaning site functions correctly and looks polished across all device sizes. Test responsive layouts, interactive features, content accuracy, and accessibility patterns to ensure the site meets all Phase 2 success criteria before moving to Phase 3 (Residential Site).

Purpose: This checkpoint ensures quality before proceeding. Catching layout issues, broken links, or missing content now prevents rework later. Human verification is essential for visual polish and user experience that automated tests cannot evaluate.

Output: Confirmed working commercial site ready for residential site development, or documented issues to address before phase completion.

  <resume-signal>
    If all checks pass, respond with: **"approved"**

    If issues found, describe each issue with:
    - Section affected (e.g., "Hero section on mobile")
    - What's wrong (e.g., "CTA button is cut off below fold")
    - Severity (blocker, major, minor)

    Example:
    ```
    Issues found:
    1. Services section on mobile - cards are overlapping (BLOCKER)
    2. Statistics animation - not triggering on scroll (MAJOR)
    3. Contact form - labels are too small (MINOR)
    ```

    I will fix blocking and major issues before marking phase complete.
