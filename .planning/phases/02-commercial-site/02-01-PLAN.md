<objective>
Prepare all content and visual assets needed to build the commercial cleaning site. Extract the logo and award badges from the current WordPress site, optimize them for web delivery (WebP with PNG fallbacks), and compile all site copy into a structured content document that can be directly referenced during HTML development.

Purpose: This plan creates the raw materials (images and copy) that all subsequent plans will use. Without these assets prepared first, HTML and CSS development would require placeholder content and repeated revisions.

Output: WebP and PNG images in docs/brand-assets/commercial/, plus a comprehensive content.md file with all site copy organized by section.

  </files>
  <action>
    Use curl or wget to download the logo and award badge images from https://angiescommercialcleaning.com. Look for:
    - Logo image (likely in header or hero section)
    - Angie's List Super Service Award badge
    - Readers Choice Award badge

    Save original images to docs/brand-assets/commercial/. Use an image optimization tool (ImageMagick if available, or online converter) to create WebP versions of each image. Keep PNG originals as fallbacks. Award badges should be sized appropriately for 120px display width.

    If curl/wget fail due to WordPress protections, use WebFetch to identify exact image URLs, then try direct download.

    **IMPORTANT:** This task completes ONLY when actual image files exist. If images are truly inaccessible via automated tools, this task MUST fail and require manual intervention. Do NOT create placeholder files or README documentation as an alternative path to completion.

    Do NOT use placeholder stock images. Real brand assets are required.
  </action>
  <verify>
    ls -lh docs/brand-assets/commercial/ shows logo.webp, logo.png, and awards/ directory with badge images. File sizes should be reasonable (logo <100KB, badges <50KB each).
  </verify>
  <done>
    docs/brand-assets/commercial/ contains optimized logo and award badge images in both WebP and PNG formats, ready for HTML <picture> element usage.

  <verify>
    cat commercial/content.md shows complete content organized by section with phone number 717-615-0968 appearing multiple times, all services listed, founder story present, and testimonial status explicitly stated. File should be 100+ lines.

After completing both tasks:
1. Run `ls -lh docs/brand-assets/commercial/` to confirm image files exist
2. Run `cat commercial/content.md | head -50` to verify content document structure
3. Check that WebP files are smaller than PNG equivalents
4. Confirm phone number 717-615-0968 appears in content.md
5. Verify award badge images are distinct (Angie's List vs Readers Choice)
6. Verify testimonial status is explicitly stated (not ambiguous)
