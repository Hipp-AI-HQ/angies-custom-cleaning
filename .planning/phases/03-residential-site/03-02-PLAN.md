<objective>
Build complete semantic HTML5 single-page residential site mirroring Phase 2 commercial structure with residential-specific content and new gift cards section.

Purpose: Create production-ready HTML foundation that reuses proven Phase 2 architecture while differentiating content tone and adding residential-specific features.

Output: 350+ line index.html with 11 sections (header, hero, services, why-us, how-it-works, statistics, testimonials, gift-cards, about, contact, footer) and all images copied to residential/images/.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Build residential index.html with all sections</name>
  <files>residential/index.html</files>
  <action>
    Create residential/index.html by duplicating commercial/index.html structure and customizing content:

    **Head section (copy verbatim, update meta/title):**
    - Meta description: Update to residential focus
    - Title: "Residential Cleaning - Angie's Custom Cleaning | Lancaster & York Counties"
    - Keep same CSS order: reset → variables → base → utilities → residential.css (not commercial.css)
    - Keep same Google Fonts preconnect

    **Header (same structure, update nav):**
    - Same sticky header pattern
    - Navigation: Add #gift-cards link, keep #services #why-us #about #contact
    - Same phone link: 717-615-0968

    **Hero (warmer tone):**
    - Headline: Use warm personal headline from content.md (e.g., "More Time for What Matters")
    - Subtitle: Emphasize trust, family, personal benefits (not business efficiency)
    - CTA: "Get Your Free Quote" (friendlier than "Get a Free Estimate")
    - Secondary CTA: "Call Now: 717-615-0968"
    - Trust badges: Same Angie's List and Readers' Choice images

    **Services section (3 cards, residential services):**
    - Card 1: Regular Cleaning - weekly/bi-weekly maintenance description from content.md
    - Card 2: Deep Cleaning - thorough top-to-bottom description
    - Card 3: Move-In/Out Cleaning - empty property intensive cleaning description
    - Use same .card .service-card structure as commercial site

    **Why Choose Us (6 benefits, homeowner-focused):**
    - Trustworthy Staff (background-checked, treat home like own)
    - Flexible Scheduling (work around family)
    - Satisfaction Guaranteed (come back if not happy)
    - Family Owned & Local (neighbors)
    - Eco-Friendly Products (safe for kids/pets)
    - Attention to Detail (little things)
    - Use same grid grid--3 structure, will wrap to 2 cols then 1 col responsively

    **How It Works (3 steps, simplified residential flow):**
    - Step 1: Call or Request Quote
    - Step 2: We Visit Your Home
    - Step 3: Enjoy Your Clean Home
    - Same structure as commercial site

    **Statistics section (residential metrics):**
    - Stat 1: data-count="12" - "Years Serving Families"
    - Stat 2: data-count="1500" data-suffix="+" - "Homes Cleaned"
    - Stat 3: data-count="100" data-suffix="%" - "Background Checked"
    - Stat 4: data-count="1" - "Family Owned"
    - Same structure as commercial, CountUp.js will wire in Plan 04

    **Testimonials (2-3 homeowner quotes):**
    - Use attributed testimonials from content.md
    - Same .testimonial blockquote structure as commercial
    - If content.md has no real testimonials, use pattern-based examples from research

    **Gift Cards section (NEW - not in commercial):**
    ```html
    <section id="gift-cards" class="gift-cards section section--dark">
      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="section__title">Give the Gift of a Clean Home</h2>
