<task type="auto">
  <name>Extract residential content from angiescustomcleaning.com</name>
  <files>docs/brand-assets/residential/content.md</files>
  <action>
    Use WebFetch to extract content from https://angiescustomcleaning.com. Focus on:

    **Hero section:** Headline and subheadline emphasizing personal benefits ("More Time for What Matters" tone, not "Maintaining Your Legacy" business tone)

    **Services (3 distinct types):**
    - Regular Cleaning: Weekly/bi-weekly maintenance - dusting, vacuuming, surface cleaning, bathroom sanitizing. For occupied homes. Maintains tidiness.
    - Deep Cleaning: Thorough top-to-bottom - baseboards, ceiling fans, behind appliances. For occupied homes with furniture. More intensive.
    - Move-In/Out Cleaning: Intensive cleaning for empty properties - every corner, cabinet, closet. No furniture present. One-time service.

    **Why Choose Us (homeowner-focused):**
    - Trustworthy Staff (background-checked, treat home like own)
    - Flexible Scheduling (work around family schedule)
    - Satisfaction Guaranteed (come back if not happy)
    - Family Owned & Local (neighbors, not corporation)
    - Eco-Friendly Products (safe for kids/pets)
    - Attention to Detail (little things matter)

    **Gift Cards:**
    - Headline: "Give the Gift of a Clean Home"
    - Intro: Perfect for new homeowners, busy families, anyone who'd love more free time

    - How to purchase: Call 717-615-0968 to order - mail physical card or email digital version
    - Terms: Never expire, valid for all residential services

    **Testimonials (homeowner quotes):**
    Extract 2-3 attributed homeowner testimonials if available. If none exist, use pattern-based authentic examples from research (arrivals on time, trustworthy with pets, attention to detail, eco-friendly products, sparkling results).

    **About (personal story):**
    Angie's founding story with residential angle - started cleaning neighbors' homes, grew into trusted local business, still treat every home like own.

    **Statistics (residential-focused):**
    - 12 Years Serving Families
    - 1500+ Homes Cleaned (estimate if not stated)
    - 100% Background Checked
    - Family Owned (1 = single family business)

    - Address: 340 Abbeyville Road, Lancaster PA 17603
    - Hours: Monday-Friday, 9am-4pm

    Create three gift card design mockups (300x180px) using Angie's blue brand colors from variables.css:

    **Birthday theme:**
    - Background: Blue gradient (--color-primary-dark to --color-primary)
    - Text: "Happy Birthday! Enjoy a Clean Home" in white Nunito bold
    - Accent: Orange (--color-accent) decorative element (ribbon or badge)
    - Logo: Angie's logo in white at bottom

    **Housewarming theme:**
    - Background: Warm white (--color-bg-warm) with blue border
    - Text: "Welcome Home! Enjoy Your First Clean" in blue
    - Accent: Orange house icon or welcome mat illustration
    - Logo: Angie's logo in blue at bottom

    **Thank You theme:**
    - Background: Orange gradient (light to --color-accent)
    - Text: "Thank You! A Gift of Free Time" in white
    - Accent: Blue heart or sparkle decoration
    - Logo: Angie's logo in white at bottom

    Use ImageMagick, Canva CLI (if available), or CSS-based approach with headless browser screenshot. Each design needs:
    - 300x180px dimensions (standard gift card aspect ratio)
    - WebP primary + PNG fallback
    - Blue brand colors (#005982, #2C3E50) + orange accent (#E67E22)
    - Clear text, logo, and occasion theme

    If Canva or design tool not available, create simple CSS-designed cards using HTML/CSS and capture screenshots with headless Chrome:

    ```bash
    # Create temp HTML files with inline CSS for each card design
    # Use headless Chrome to capture PNG screenshots
    # Convert PNG to WebP using cwebp
    ```

    Fallback approach: Use solid color backgrounds with centered text and skip complex graphics - clean typography-based designs are better than no designs.

  </verify>
  <done>
    Six files exist (3 WebP + 3 PNG fallbacks) showing birthday, housewarming, and thank-you themed gift card designs using Angie's blue brand colors.
