<objective>
Create the test HTML page that validates the entire design system visually, then copy all shared CSS files into both site directories.

Purpose: The test page is the proof that the design system works at all breakpoints -- it validates typography, colors, grid layout, buttons, and section backgrounds before any real page is built. Copying CSS to site directories prepares for Phase 2 and Phase 3.

Output: shared/test.html (comprehensive design system demo page) + CSS copies in commercial/css/ and residential/css/

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create comprehensive test HTML page</name>
  <files>shared/test.html</files>
  <action>
Create `shared/test.html` -- a comprehensive design system validation page. This is NOT a minimal style guide -- it must test actual layout patterns that Phase 2 and 3 will use (see RESEARCH.md Pitfall 6).

**Head section:**
- DOCTYPE html, lang="en", charset UTF-8, viewport meta
- Title: "Design System Test - Angie's Custom Cleaning"
- Google Fonts preconnect hints (two link tags: fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com with crossorigin)
- Google Fonts stylesheet: Nunito wght 700 and 800, Open Sans wght 400 and 600, display=swap
- Four CSS link tags (NOT @import): reset.css, variables.css, base.css, utilities.css -- paths relative: "css/reset.css" etc.

**Body sections (in order):**

1. **Hero Section** (class="section section--dark"):
   - .container with h1 "Angie's Custom Cleaning" (tests --fs-xxl, Nunito 800, white text on dark bg)
   - Subtitle paragraph: "Professional Cleaning Services in Lancaster, PA" (tests --fs-md, Open Sans on dark)
   - Two buttons side by side: "Get a Free Quote" (.btn .btn--primary) and "Our Services" (.btn .btn--outline with white text variant)

2. **Typography Section** (class="section"):
   - .container with h2 "Typography Scale"
   - All six heading levels (h1 through h6) with descriptive text like "Heading 1 -- fs-xxl (Nunito 800)"
   - Body text paragraph (2-3 sentences about cleaning services -- representative length, not lorem ipsum)
   - A paragraph with a link to test link styling
   - Small text example using class or --fs-sm

3. **Color Palette Section** (class="section section--alt"):
   - .container with h2 "Color Palette"
   - A .grid.grid--3 of color swatch cards, each card showing:
     - A colored div (60px height, border-radius) with the actual color as background
     - The color name and hex value below
   - Show at minimum: Primary (#005982), Primary Light (#0077AD), Primary Dark (#003D5C), Accent (#E67E22), Accent Hover (#D35400), Background (#FDFAF6), Background Alt (#F5F0EB), Text (#2C3E50), Text Light (#5D6D7E)
   - Use inline styles ONLY for the swatch background-color (since each swatch needs a unique color). Everything else uses design tokens.

4. **Service Cards Section** (class="section"):
   - .container with h2 "Service Cards"
   - .grid.grid--3 with three .card elements:
     - Card 1: "Office Cleaning" -- h3, short description paragraph, .btn.btn--primary "Learn More"
     - Card 2: "Carpet Cleaning" -- h3, short description paragraph, .btn.btn--primary "Learn More"
     - Card 3: "Floor Care" -- h3, short description paragraph, .btn.btn--primary "Learn More"
   - This tests the 3-column responsive grid: 1 col on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop

5. **Buttons Section** (class="section section--alt"):
   - .container with h2 "Buttons"
   - Row of buttons: .btn.btn--primary ("Primary Button"), .btn.btn--outline ("Outline Button")
   - Second row: same buttons but demonstrate hover state description in a paragraph

6. **Trust Signals Section** (class="section section--dark"):
   - .container with h2 "Trust Signals" (white text on dark)
   - .grid.grid--3 with three stat items (text-center):
     - "20+" with "Years in Business" below
     - "500+" with "Happy Clients" below
     - "15+" with "Industry Awards" below
   - Tests dark background with light text, grid layout, centered text

7. **Spacing & Shadows Section** (class="section"):
   - .container with h2 "Spacing & Shadows"
   - Four boxes demonstrating shadow-sm, shadow-md, shadow-lg, shadow-xl (use .grid.grid--2 or inline arrangement)
   - Each box labeled with its shadow level

8. **Footer Section** (class="section section--dark" with reduced padding):
   - .container with centered text
   - "Angie's Custom Cleaning" heading (h4)
   - "340 Abbeyville Road, Lancaster PA 17603"
   - "717-615-0968"
   - "Mon-Fri 9am-4pm"

Use representative cleaning-business text throughout -- short, realistic phrases. Do NOT use lorem ipsum. Keep descriptions brief (1-2 sentences per card/section).

Do NOT add any inline CSS except for the color swatch backgrounds. All styling comes from the four CSS files.

shared/test.html is a comprehensive design system test page with 8 sections: hero (dark bg, buttons), typography (all heading levels + body text), color palette (swatch grid), service cards (3-col responsive grid with cards), buttons (both variants), trust signals (dark bg stats grid), spacing/shadows (shadow examples), and footer (dark bg, contact info). Google Fonts loaded with preconnect + display=swap. No @import, no lorem ipsum, no inline CSS except color swatches.

  <name>Task 2: Copy shared CSS to both site directories</name>
  <files>commercial/css/reset.css, commercial/css/variables.css, commercial/css/base.css, commercial/css/utilities.css, residential/css/reset.css, residential/css/variables.css, residential/css/base.css, residential/css/utilities.css</files>
  <action>
Create the CSS directories and copy all four shared CSS files to both site directories. This is required because Vercel deploys each site from its own root directory and cannot access files outside that root.

1. Create `commercial/css/` directory
2. Create `residential/css/` directory
3. Copy all four files from `shared/css/` to `commercial/css/`:
   - `cp shared/css/reset.css commercial/css/reset.css`
   - `cp shared/css/variables.css commercial/css/variables.css`
   - `cp shared/css/base.css commercial/css/base.css`
   - `cp shared/css/utilities.css commercial/css/utilities.css`
4. Copy all four files from `shared/css/` to `residential/css/`:
   - `cp shared/css/reset.css residential/css/reset.css`
   - `cp shared/css/variables.css residential/css/variables.css`
   - `cp shared/css/base.css residential/css/base.css`
   - `cp shared/css/utilities.css residential/css/utilities.css`
5. Verify all copies are byte-identical to the shared originals using `diff` or `cmp`

The `shared/css/` directory remains the source of truth. Site directories hold copies for deployment. Per RESEARCH.md Pitfall 5: always edit in shared/ first, then copy.
  </action>

- `ls commercial/css/` shows all four CSS files

  </verify>
  <done>
Both commercial/css/ and residential/css/ contain byte-identical copies of all four shared CSS files (reset.css, variables.css, base.css, utilities.css). Both sites are ready for Phase 2 and Phase 3 to start building HTML pages that reference these CSS files directly.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete CSS design system (4 files) and comprehensive test HTML page with all component types at all breakpoints</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open `shared/test.html` in a browser (just double-click the file or use a local server)
2. Check at FULL WIDTH (1024px+):
   - Service cards should be in a 3-column grid
   - Trust signals should be in a 3-column grid
   - Typography has clear visual hierarchy (h1 is noticeably larger than h2, etc.)
3. Resize browser to TABLET (768px):
   - Service cards should be in a 2-column grid
   - Content should not overflow horizontally
4. Resize browser to MOBILE (375px):
   - Everything should be single column
   - No horizontal scrolling
   - Headings should not overflow their container
5. Check the COLOR FEEL:
   - Background should be warm cream-white (not stark white)
   - Blue should feel warm/teal (not cold corporate)
   - Orange accent buttons should pop against the blue
   - Dark sections should use deep navy, not black
6. Check FONTS:
   - Headings should be in Nunito (rounded, friendly sans-serif)
   - Body text should be in Open Sans (clean, readable sans-serif)
   - No visible flash of unstyled text on reload (fonts load quickly via preconnect)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if the design system looks warm, trustworthy, and responsive. Or describe any issues (colors too cold, layout broken at a breakpoint, fonts not loading, etc.)</resume-signal>
